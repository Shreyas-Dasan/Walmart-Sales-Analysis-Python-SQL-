Objectives:

  1. Understand sales patterns and customer preferences.
  2. Identify high-performing branches and product categories.
  3. Discover trends in payment methods, busy hours, and revenue distribution.
  4. Generate actionable business insights to support data-driven decisions.

Tools & Technologies:

  1. Python: Data Cleaning, EDA, and Visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
  2. PostgreSQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) for advanced business analysis.
  3. Jupyter Notebook: For code exploration and interactive analysis.

Key Insights:

From Python analysis:

  1. Branch- and product-wise revenue distribution
  2. Month-wise and gender-wise purchase trends
  3. Correlation between rating, quantity sold, and total sales
  4. Visual insights into sales by category, gender, city, and payment methods

From SQL analysis:

  1. Most used payment method and busiest time slot by branch.
  2. Top-performing product categories by rating and profit.
  3. Branches with declining revenue compared to previous year.
  4. Sales shift trends (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and customer footfall.
